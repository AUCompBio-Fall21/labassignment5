+Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable 
work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility test? How do you think non-reproducibile research affects 
computational biology and bioinformatics? What about in your specific field of study

I currently have no experience with coding or managing "big data", but I usually do not see any way to access 
data or code on the papers I read. 
The absence of those informations seems like it would make reproducibility 
difficult or impossible in any fields.
The absence of reproducibility makes science very messy, feeling like everybody does everything on their side without any concensus, which would slow progress and lower the quality of the research.
