# Lab Assignment 4
Github for Lab Assignment 4 (Week 7 - Version Control)


## Learning Objectives 

- Applying version control software to track changes to code using git and github
- Using remote repositories to share code and edits 
- Working collaboratively, using git and github, to correct errors in code to make it functional 
- Reflecting on how version control software contributes to reproducibility 

## Getting Started

1. Begin having one member in each group fork **this** repository to their github account 

![Forking A Repo](/images/forkrepo.png)

2. The member that forked this repository should now add the second member as a collaborator on the repository 

    A. Click Settings
    
    ![Settings Menu](/images/settings.png)
    
    B. Click Manage access
    
    ![Manage Access](/images/manageaccess.png)
    
    C. Click Invite a collaborator

    D. Use your partner's github account name to add them
        
     **NOTE: There may be a limit on how many collaborators can be added. *In this case, split up into a group of 3 and a group of 2.***
    
3. Use the url for the repository and `git remote` to set up a remote connection to your newly forked repository locally (or on ASC) at the command line.

## Collaborative Coding

4. Find and navigate to your assigned group's directory (i.e., "room_1")in the repository and examine the contents. You should find scripts that are jumbled and/or missing some important parts. 

5. You and your partner(s) will work together to write a single script that performs the action listed in the README file (also in your group's directory), using the provided unfinished/incorrect scripts. 

6. Each partner must make commits to the collaborative repository for assignment credit. The goal is to work together to pull together a functional script to carry out an action, but do not worry if you cannot get your code to run properly - focus on adding, committing, and pushing changes to your collaborative repository in a responsible way. 

## Lab Submission

7. Upload the following to canvas:

    a. Respond to the following reflection question and upload your response to canvas in a file called **NAME_reflection.txt**
    
    *Reflect on how you currently manage your documents and code, particularly content associated with publishable work. Would it stand up to a reproducibility     test? Why do you think it is important (or not) to assess the reproducibility of your work?*
    
    b. Paste a link to your collaborative repository for this lab into a file called **NAME_VCL.txt** along with redirected output from `git log`.
