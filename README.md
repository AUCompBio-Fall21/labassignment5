# Lab Assignment 4
Github for Lab Assignment 4 (Week 7 - Version Control)


## Learning Objectives 

- Applying version control software to track changes to code using git and github
- Using remote repositories to share code and edits 
- Working collaboratively, using git and github, to correct errors in code to make it functional 
- Reflecting on how version control software contributes to reproducibility 

## Getting Started

1. Pair up within your groups

2. Begin having one member in each pair fork **this** repository to their github account

3. The member that forked this repository should now add the second member as a collaborator on the repository 
    a. Click Settings

    b. Click Manage access

    c. Click Invite a collaborator

    d. Use your partner's github account name to add them
    
4. Use `git clone` and `git remote` to set up a remote connection to your newly forked repository locally (or on ASC)

5. Navigate to your group directory in the repository and examine the contents. You should find scripts that are jumbled and/or missing some important parts. You and your partner will work together to write a single script that performs the action in your group directory README, using these partial scripts. 

6. Each partner must make commits to the collaborative repository for assignment credit. The goal is to work together to pull together a functional script to carry out an action, but do not worry if you cannot get your code to run properly - focus on adding, committing, and pushing changes to your collaborative repository in a responsible way.
