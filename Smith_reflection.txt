My current management of data and code definately does not stand up to the reproducibility test as it is all done locally, or is stored on a shared lab hard drive. By not being reproducible studies in the fields of computational biologu and bioinformatics are not able to be reproduced exactly as they were. Researchers have to reach out to those who conducted the original study and attempt to get the code or data. If they can not get either they have to produce their own which may give different results which creates confustion as to which result is accurate. In my field of study sharing of code would be especially helpful to compare differences in population behavior across spatial differences.
